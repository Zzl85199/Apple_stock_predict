# Apple Stock Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project utilizes historical stock price data from Apple Inc. to build predictive models using both deep learning (LSTM networks) and traditional machine learning techniques (Ridge regression). The aim is to forecast future stock prices based on patterns deduced from past price movements.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, extracting year and month from dates, and computing daily price changes.
- **Visualization:** Trend analysis of stock volumes and adjusted closing prices over time.
- **Modeling:** Use of LSTM for initial predictions and Ridge regression for error correction.
- **Evaluation:** Performance assessment through Mean Squared Error (MSE) across training, validation, and test datasets.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following installed:
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Scikit-Learn
- Keras
- TensorFlow

Ensure you also have access to Google Colab or any Jupyter environment.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zzl85199/apple_stock_predict.git
```


## Usage
1. Mount your Google Drive to access the dataset:
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```
2. Load and preprocess the data:
   ```python
   data = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/My Drive/Kaggle/AAPL.csv.xls", parse_dates=['Date'])
   ```
3. Follow the Jupyter Notebook for detailed steps on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Models

- **LSTM Model**: Captures complex stock price sequence patterns for forecasting.
- **Ridge Regression Model**: Provides error correction post LSTM predictions to refine accuracy.

## Results

Discuss your findings on model performance, including any charts or graphs comparing the predicted prices with actual prices.
